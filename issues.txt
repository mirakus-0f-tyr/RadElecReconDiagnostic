- CreatePDF - "WARNING: Warning: You did not close a PDF Document" appears regularly but the final document seems okay

- connection errors during comm port scanning - usually solved with another connect attempt, but why is this happening?

- App worked on Mac, but performed VERY slowly (it COULD be all the tty devices it's checking - ask for the output)

- graph not shown during Mac test (commas as separators in decimal numbers - need to force locale?)  See exception:
	Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "5,945"

- Mac port listed correctly when double-clicking on jar to run, but running from command line did not show the correct value

- Connected to above connection errors: With the new, separate methods of CreateTXT and CreateXLS, the unit is downloaded
  twice.  Whereas before it was "all or nothing," now there is the possibility of successfully downloading the text file
  but having a connect-fail on the second download.  More scrutiny should be placed on what is happening here to notify
  the user and correct any problems.

- Windows: It was observed in one case that repeatedly clicking Connect button did not result in the unit being recognized, although the unit
  was recognized by Windows in Device Manager.  It is unclear what caused this...a reboot fixed the problem, but something happened.

OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO

- have an installer

- have a convenient way for users to update

- sort through library jars and remove any that aren't necessary

- be aware of distribution terms for every library jar before we release
