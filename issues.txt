- Add handling for wait times and TEST

- CreatePDF - "WARNING: Warning: You did not close a PDF Document" appears regularly but the final document seems okay

OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO

- have a convenient way for users to update

- sort through library jars and remove any that aren't necessary

- be aware of distribution terms for every library jar before we release
