- Add handling for wait times and TEST

- CreatePDF - "WARNING: Warning: You did not close a PDF Document" appears regularly but the final document seems okay

- connection errors during comm port scanning - usually solved with another connect attempt, but why is this happening?

- App worked on Mac, but performed VERY slowly (it COULD be all the tty devices it's checking - ask for the output)

- graph not shown during Mac test (commas as separators in decimal numbers - need to force locale?)  See exception:
	Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "5,945"

- Mac port listed correctly when double-clicking on jar to run, but running from command line did not show the correct value

- Windows: It was observed in one case that repeatedly clicking Connect button did not result in the unit being recognized, although the unit
  was recognized by Windows in Device Manager.  It is unclear what caused this...a reboot fixed the problem, but something happened.

SETTING THE DISPLAY FLAG VALUE
The method now appears to be writing the flag correctly. What is returned by :RF after setting is always what should have been
written, but there have been some occasions where issuing :RF in a console after power cycle will reveal that the flag was not successfully
"saved" when the unit is turned off. I believe this is an unknown firmware problem and not a problem with this app, but keep eyes out for this.

OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO

- have a convenient way for users to update

- sort through library jars and remove any that aren't necessary

- be aware of distribution terms for every library jar before we release
