v0.1.0 - Initial Release. July 2016.
v0.2.0 - Can now issue :CD command to move to next record. August 2016.
v0.3.0 - Entire data dump implemented, but this is still shoddy work. August 2016.
v0.4.0 - Clean up old modules and methods. Implement this changelog.txt file. August 15 2016.
v0.4.1 - Switched temperature/humidity/pressure avg. and max. columns; I had them labeled incorrectly. September 12 2016.
v0.5.0 - Refined many of the functions; software should no longer lock when issuing :CD/:CM commands. September 15 2016.
v0.5.1 - Improved file-naming method, which will include the Recon's serial#, start date of the test, and a file counter. October 7 2016.
v0.5.2 - Added underscore between serial number and date in the XLS file. Records per sample column should now display properly. Added two instrument settings from header file to TXT file. October 11 2016.
v0.5.3 - Added counts per hour for each chamber to the spreadsheet. November 4 2016.
v0.5.4 - Reduced thread sleeps by 50%, which should increase data transfer speed accordingly (provided stuff doesn't start to break!). 10-Nov-2016
v0.5.5 - Further sanitized code, removing a few more artifacts from the Scout Quick Cal program. Added a basic config menu, with company information. Reduced thread sleeps by another 50%. 18-Jul-2017
v0.5.6 - Added radon concentrations to the spreadsheet, in addition to a CheckCalibrationFactors method to pull CF1 and CF2 from the Recon. 21-Jul-2017
v0.5.7 - Created framework for config.txt and company.txt, which allows user to toggle between "end-user" and "diagnostic" modes (config.txt) and to read company information (company.txt). 24-July-2017
v0.5.8 - Added some buttons for the end-user mode (no functionality implemented), and a text area for the test site information. 25-July-2017
v0.5.9 - Initial overhaul of the Config menu, adding two tabs. Company settings will now be saved, and the AppMode can be selected. 26-July-2017.
v0.5.10 - Got DownloadSession button working. Edited DownloadNewRecord() -- xls only created in Diagnostic mode. Test site info parsed from app window to text file. Averages in text file still need to be completed. 26-July-2017
v0.5.11 - Added some error-handling to parseConfigTXT(). The config.txt file should now be able to be parsed in any order (as long as the syntax is still correct). Current config settings will now reload when Connect button is pressed. 26-July-2017
v0.5.12 - End-User Mode: Open Saved File now pulls a text file and stores it in an ArrayList, ready to be turned into a graph. 28-Jul-2017.
v0.5.13 - Primitive graph should now load, to display Ch1_Counts and Ch2_Counts (soon these will be updated into valid data; it's more proof-of-concept).
v0.8.4 - Changed "Erase Recon Data" to "Clear Session", and altered its call from :CM (clear all memory) to :CD (clear current session). This will improve its functionality for our end-users, who are currently terrified to use it.
v0.8.5 - Altered FileUpdater so that the file to be updated can (a) be loaded from any directory and (b) have a custom filename.
v0.8.6 - Fix DrawCustomerTestSiteBlock() in CreatePDF class to properly sanitize customer and test site strings. This should fix at least some lock-ups when generating a PDF report.
v0.8.7 - Create class for TiltSensitivity, to make it easier to find and tweak. Commented out original tilt sensitivity code block in CreateGraph class.
v0.8.8 - Change ReadFirstRecord declaration in ReconCommand class from :RN1 to :RN0, so that we don't skip over the very first record in memory.
v0.8.9 - macOS compatibility (explicitly searches for tty.usbmodem). Skip over D (debug) records when downloading a session (via "Download Session" or "Create TXT/XLS" buttons). Added ability to disable count limiter via config file option (COUNT_LIMITER=OFF).
v0.9.0 - Basic commenting feature to config.txt. Other miscellaneous tweaks.
v0.9.1 - Updated FileUpdater.java to stop removing instrument serial.
v0.9.2 - Detect operating system on software boot, and create a special Recon folder in macOS documents folder. Robust font fallbacks, for users that don't have Calibri font. Added "no averaging / every ten minutes" display setting.
v0.9.3 - Preliminary logging system. Multiple iterative fixes and cleanup. Added message box which reports success or failure when writing display/option flag. Added "preview" to Display Options form.
v0.9.4 - Initial implementation of digital signature, which should be located in config folder. The file should be a BMP/PNG/JPG/JPEG and located in config directory.
